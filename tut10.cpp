/*
Loops in C++
Loops are block statements, which keeps on repeatedly executing until a specified condition is met. There are three types of loops in C++

1.For loop in C++
For loop help us to run some specific code repeatedly until the specified condition is met. 

2.While loop in C++
While loop helps us to run some specific code repeatedly until the specified condition is met

3.Do While in C++
The do-while loop helps us to run some specific code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.
